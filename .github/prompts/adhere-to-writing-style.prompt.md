The following is a set of guidelines to follow when writing documentation for .NET Aspire. Please ensure that all documentation adheres to these guidelines:

## Voice and tone

Write for readers who may have a limited vocabulary or are not native English speakers. Use simple, clear language and avoid jargon whenever possible. If you must use technical terms, provide a brief explanation of what they mean.

- Use active voice
- Use the second person (you, your) to address the reader directly

## Headings

Headings use sentence-style capitalization. Always capitalize the first word of a heading. Do not use gerunds (e.g., "Using" or "Creating") in heading.

## Text styling

Use _italics_ for files, folders, paths (for long items, split onto their own line), new terms.

Use **bold** for UI elements.

Use `code` for inline code, language keywords, NuGet package names, command-line commands, database table and column names, and URLs that you don't want to be clickable.

## Links

Strive to use relative links whenever possible. Use absolute links only when necessary. For example, if you are linking to a page on a different site, use an absolute link. When using absolute links, use the full URL (including the protocol) and remove the locale from the URL. For example, use `https://learn.microsoft.com` instead of `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us`. Avoid HTTP links. Whenever providing additional resources, use the following format:

"For more information, see [link text](../relative/link/to/content.md)."

## Things to avoid

- Avoid future tense: In some non-English languages the concept of future tense is not the same as English. Using future tense can make your documents harder to read.
- Avoid passive voice: Passive voice can make your writing less clear and harder to read. Use active voice whenever possible.
