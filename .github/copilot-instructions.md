# .NET Aspire Documentation Guidelines

## Documentation rules
- Add a redirect entry to [.openpublishing.redirection.json](../.openpublishing.redirection.json) when you delete a Markdown file.
- For Markdown files generated by AI, disclose AI assistance by adding this frontmatter key/value pair:

```markdown
ai-usage: ai-generated
```

## Terminology

- First mention: ".NET Aspire", subsequent mentions: "Aspire"
- Instead of "app host", always say "AppHost"
- All .NET content refers to modern .NET (not .NET Framework)

## Writing Style

Follow [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) with these specifics:

### Voice and Tone

- Active voice, second person addressing reader directly
- Conversational tone with contractions
- Present tense for instructions/descriptions
- Imperative mood for instructions ("Call the method" not "You should call the method")
- Use "might" instead of "may" for possibility
- Avoid "we"/"our" referring to documentation authors

### Structure and Format

- Sentence case headings (no gerunds in titles)
- Be concise, break up long sentences
- Oxford comma in lists
- Number all ordered list items as "1." (not sequential numbering like "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.)
- Complete sentences with proper punctuation in all list items
- Avoid "etc." or "and so on" - provide complete lists or use "for example"
- No consecutive headings without content between them

### Formatting Conventions

- **Bold** for UI elements
- `Code style` for file names, folders, custom types, non-localizable text
- Raw URLs in angle brackets
- Use relative links for files in this repo
- Remove `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us` from learn.microsoft.com links

## API References

Use cross-references: `<xref:api-doc-ID>`

To find API doc IDs:
1. Check XML files in https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs
2. For types: `Value` attribute of `<TypeSignature>` where `Language="DocId"` (omit first 2 characters)
3. For members: `Value` attribute of `<MemberSignature>` where `Language="DocId"` (omit first 2 characters)

If unsure, use API browser: `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/apibrowser/dotnet/search?api-version=0.2&locale=en-us&search={API_NAME}&$skip=0&$top=5`

Use the `url` value from results for manual links.

## Code Snippets

For snippets >6 lines:
1. Create `snippets/my-doc/` folder in same directory as document (for a document named `my-doc.md`)
1. Add snippet as separate `.cs` file
1. Include simple `.csproj` targeting latest .NET
1. All code should use the latest stable versions/features

## File Naming

New Markdown files: lowercase with hyphens, omit filler words (the, a, etc.)

## Special Cases

- Breaking changes: Include directions from [`.github/prompts/breaking-change.md`](./prompts/breaking-change.md).
