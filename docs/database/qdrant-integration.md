# .NET Aspire Qdrant integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is an open-source vector similarity search engine that efficiently stores, indexes, and searches large-scale vector data. It's commonly used in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science applications.

Vector data encodes information as mathematical vectors, which are arrays of numbers or coordinates. Machine learning and AI systems often use vectors to represent unstructured objects like images, text, audio, or video. Each dimension in the vector describes a specific characteristic of the object. By comparing them, systems can classify, search, and identify clusters of objects.

In this article, you learn how to use the .NET Aspire Qdrant integration. The .NET Aspire Qdrant integration enables you to connect to existing Qdrant databases or create new instances with the [`qdrant/qdrant` container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/qdrant/qdrant).

## Hosting integration

The Qdrant hosting integration models the server as the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.QdrantServerResource> type. To access this type and APIs, add the [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant) NuGet package in the [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add Qdrant resource

In your app host project, call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.QdrantBuilderExtensions.AddQdrant*> to add and return a Qdrant resource builder.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var qdrant = builder.AddQdrant("qdrant")
                    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(qdrant)
       .WaitFor(qdrant);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Qdrant container can be slow to start, so it's best to use a _persistent_ lifetime to avoid unnecessary restarts. For more information, see [Container resource lifetime](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#container-resource-lifetime).

In this article, you learn how to use the .NET Aspire Qdrant integration. Use this integration to register a [QdrantClient](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-dotnet) in the DI container for connecting to a Qdrant server.

## Get started

To get started with the .NET Aspire Qdrant integration, install the [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.Qdrant.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Qdrant.Client) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, i.e., the project for the application that uses the Qdrant client.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Qdrant.Client
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Qdrant.Client"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

## Example usage

In the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddQdrantClient` extension method to register a `QdrantClient` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddQdrantClient("qdrant");
```

To retrieve your `QdrantClient` object consider the following example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(QdrantClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

## App host usage

To model the Qdrant server resource in the app host, install the [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant) NuGet package in the [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Qdrant"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

In your app host project, register a Qdrant server and consume the connection using the following methods:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var qdrant = builder.AddQdrant("qdrant");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyService>()
                       .WithReference(qdrant);
```

When you want to explicitly provide the API key, you can provide it as a parameter. Consider the following alternative example:

```csharp
var apiKey = builder.AddParameter("apikey", secret: true);

var qdrant = builder.AddQdrant("qdrant", apiKey);

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyService>()
                       .WithReference(qdrant);
```

For more information, see [External parameters](../fundamentals/external-parameters.md).

## Configuration

The .NET Aspire Qdrant Client integration provides multiple options to configure the server connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling `builder.AddQdrantClient()`:

```csharp
builder.AddQdrantClient("qdrant");
```

And then the connection string will be retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "qdrant": "Endpoint=http://localhost:6334;Key=123456!@#$%"
  }
}
```

By default the `QdrantClient` uses the gRPC API endpoint.

### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Qdrant Client integration supports [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration). It loads the `QdrantClientSettings` from configuration by using the `Aspire:Qdrant:Client` key. Example `appsettings.json` that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Qdrant": {
      "Client": {
        "Key": "123456!@#$%"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<QdrantClientSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to set the API key from code:

```csharp
builder.AddQdrantClient("qdrant", settings => settings.ApiKey = "12345!@#$%");
```

### Logging

The .NET Aspire Qdrant integration uses the following logging categories:

- "Qdrant.Client"
