# Aspire SQL Server Entity Framework Core integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. The Aspire SQL Server Entity Framework Core integration enables you to connect to existing SQL Server instances or create new instances from .NET with the [`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server).

## Hosting integration

[!INCLUDE [sql-app-host](includes/sql-app-host.md)]

### Hosting integration health checks

The SQL Server hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the SQL Server resource. The health check verifies that the SQL Server is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [📦 AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer) NuGet package.

## Client integration

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-ef-client](includes/sql-server-ef-client.md)]
