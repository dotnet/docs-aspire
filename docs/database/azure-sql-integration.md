# Aspire Azure SQL integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[Azure SQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-sql) is a family of relational database management systems that run in the Azure cloud. The database systems are Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) products that enable database administrators to implement highly scalable and available databases without maintaining complex infrastructures themselves. The Aspire Azure SQL Server Hosting integration provides methods to create a new Azure Database server and databases from code in your Aspire AppHost project. In a consuming project, you can use the Aspire SQL Server client integration as you would for any other SQL Server instance.
