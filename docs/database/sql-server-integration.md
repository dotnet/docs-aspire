# .NET Aspire SQL Server integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. The .NET Aspire SQL Server integration enables you to connect to existing SQL Server instances or create new instances from .NET with the [`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server).

## Hosting integration

[!INCLUDE [sql-app-host](includes/sql-app-host.md)]

### Hosting integration health checks

The SQL Server hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the SQL Server resource. The health check verifies that the SQL Server is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [ðŸ“¦ AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer) NuGet package.

## Client integration

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-client](includes/sql-server-client.md)]
