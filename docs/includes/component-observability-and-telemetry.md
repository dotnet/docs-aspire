## Observability and telemetry

.NET Aspire components automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as *the pillars of observability*. For more information about component observability and telemetry, see [.NET Aspire components overview](../fundamentals/components-overview.md). Depending on the backing service, some components may only support some of these features. For example, some components support logging and tracing, but not metrics. Telemetry features can also be disabled using the techniques presented in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
