### Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire _client integrations_ have [health checks](../fundamentals/health-checks.md) enabled for all services. Similarly, many Aspire _hosting integrations_ also enable health check endpoints. For more information, see:

- [.NET app health checks in C#](/dotnet/core/diagnostics/diagnostic-health-checks)
- [Health checks in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks)
