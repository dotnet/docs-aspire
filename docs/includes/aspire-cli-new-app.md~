The Aspire CLI can lead you through the choices necessary to create a new Aspire solution, based on one of the Aspire templates. Complete the following steps to create a project for this quickstart:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to a folder where you want to work. The Aspire CLI will create a new subdirectory and places the entire solution in it.
1. To run the Aspire CLI, execute the following command:

    ```aspire-cli
    aspire new
    ```

1. The Aspire CLI presents a list of templates for you to choose from. Select `Starter template` and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Enter a name for the new solution, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Enter a folder for the new solution. The default name is the solution name that you just entered.
1. Select the default version of Aspire, which is the latest version on NuGet. Alternatively you can select the latest daily or stable builds of Aspire.
1. Choose `Yes` to include a Redis Cache integration in the solution.
1. Choose `No` to exclude a test project from the solution. The Aspire CLI creates the new solution.

> [!NOTE]
> You chose not to add a test project to the new solution. You can always add a test project later but it's not needed for this quickstart.
