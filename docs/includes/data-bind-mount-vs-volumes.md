> [!TIP]
> Data [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) have limited functionality compared to [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/), which offer better performance, portability, and security, making them more suitable for production environments. However, bind mounts allow direct access and modification of files on the host system, ideal for development and testing where real-time changes are needed.
