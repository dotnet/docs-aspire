# .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration

[!INCLUDE [includes-hosting-and-client](../includes/includes-hosting-and-client.md)]

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a reliable messaging and streaming broker, which is easy to deploy on cloud environments, on-premises, and on your local machine. The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration enables you to connect to existing RabbitMQ instances, or create new instances from .NET with the [`docker.io/library/rabbitmq` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq).

<!-- 
TODO: Diagram showing the thing we're integrating with and the components of the integration.

## Hosting integration

The RabbitMQ hosting integration models a RabbitMQ server as the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.RabbitMQServerResource> type. To access this type and its APIs add the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQ) NuGet package in the [AppHost](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQ
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQ"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

### Add RabbitMQ server resource

In your AppHost project, call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQBuilderExtensions.AddRabbitMQ*> on the `builder` instance to add a RabbitMQ server resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var rabbitmq = builder.AddRabbitMQ("messaging");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(rabbitmq);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When .NET Aspire adds a container image to the AppHost, as shown in the preceding example with the `docker.io/library/rabbitmq` image, it creates a new RabbitMQ server instance on your local machine. A reference to your RabbitMQ server (the `rabbitmq` variable) is added to the `ExampleProject`. The RabbitMQ server resource includes default credentials with a `username` of `"guest"` and randomly generated `password` using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.CreateDefaultPasswordParameter*> method.

The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> method configures a connection in the `ExampleProject` named `"messaging"`. For more information, see [Container resource lifecycle](../fundamentals/orchestrate-resources.md#container-resource-lifecycle).

> [!TIP]
> If you'd rather connect to an existing RabbitMQ server, call <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.AddConnectionString*> instead. For more information, see [Reference existing resources](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#reference-existing-resources).

### Add RabbitMQ server resource with data volume

To add a data volume to the RabbitMQ server resource, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQBuilderExtensions.WithDataVolume*> method on the RabbitMQ server resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var rabbitmq = builder.AddRabbitMQ("messaging")
                      .WithDataVolume(isReadOnly: false);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
        .WithReference(rabbitmq);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The data volume is used to persist the RabbitMQ server data outside the lifecycle of its container. The data volume is mounted at the `/var/lib/rabbitmq` path in the RabbitMQ server container and when a `name` parameter isn't provided, the name is generated at random. For more information on data volumes and details on why they're preferred over [bind mounts](#add-rabbitmq-server-resource-with-data-bind-mount), see [Docker docs: Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes).

### Add RabbitMQ server resource with data bind mount

To add a data bind mount to the RabbitMQ server resource, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQBuilderExtensions.WithDataBindMount*> method:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var rabbitmq = builder.AddRabbitMQ("messaging")
                      .WithDataBindMount(
                          source: @"C:\RabbitMQ\Data",
                          isReadOnly: false);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
        .WithReference(rabbitmq);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

[!INCLUDE [data-bind-mount-vs-volumes](../includes/data-bind-mount-vs-volumes.md)]

Data bind mounts rely on the host machine's filesystem to persist the RabbitMQ server data across container restarts. The data bind mount is mounted at the `C:\RabbitMQ\Data` on Windows (or `/RabbitMQ/Data` on Unix) path on the host machine in the RabbitMQ server container. For more information on data bind mounts, see [Docker docs: Bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts).

### Add RabbitMQ server resource with parameters

When you want to explicitly provide the username and password used by the container image, you can provide these credentials as parameters. Consider the following alternative example:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var username = builder.AddParameter("username", secret: true);
var password = builder.AddParameter("password", secret: true);

var rabbitmq = builder.AddRabbitMQ("messaging", username, password);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(rabbitmq);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

For more information on providing parameters, see [External parameters](../fundamentals/external-parameters.md).

### Add RabbitMQ server resource with management plugin

To add the [RabbitMQ management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management) to the RabbitMQ server resource, call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RabbitMQBuilderExtensions.WithManagementPlugin*> method. Remember to use parameters to set the credentials for the container. You'll need these credentials to log into the management plugin:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var username = builder.AddParameter("username", secret: true);
var password = builder.AddParameter("password", secret: true);

var rabbitmq = builder.AddRabbitMQ("messaging", username, password)
                      .WithManagementPlugin();

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
        .WithReference(rabbitmq);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The RabbitMQ management plugin provides an HTTP-based API for management and monitoring of your RabbitMQ server. .NET Aspire adds another container image [`docker.io/library/rabbitmq-management`](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq) to the AppHost that runs the management plugin. You can access the management plugin from the .NET Aspire dashboard by selecting an endpoint for your RabbitMQ resource:

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-access-rabbitmq-management.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard showing how to connect to the RabbitMQ management plugin.":::

Log into the management plugin using the credentials you configured with parameters:

:::image type="content" source="media/rabbitmq-management-plugin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the RabbitMQ management plugin.":::

For more information, see [Container resource lifetimes](../fundamentals/orchestrate-resources.md#container-resource-lifetime).

### Hosting integration health checks

The RabbitMQ hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the RabbitMQ server resource. The health check verifies that the RabbitMQ server is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [📦 AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Rabbitmq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Rabbitmq) NuGet package.

## Client integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire RabbitMQ client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the RabbitMQ client. The RabbitMQ client integration registers an [IConnection](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/api/RabbitMQ.Client.IConnection.html) instance that you can use to interact with RabbitMQ.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client"
                  Version="*" />
```

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client` NuGet package depends on the `RabbitMQ.Client` NuGet package. With the release of version 7.0.0 of `RabbitMQ.Client`, a binary breaking change was introduced. To address this, a new client integration package, `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7`, was created. The original `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client` package continues to reference `RabbitMQ.Client` version 6.8.1, ensuring compatibility with previous versions of the RabbitMQ client integration. The new `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7` package references `RabbitMQ.Client` version 7.0.0. In a future version of .NET Aspire, the `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client` will be updated to version `7.x` and the `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7` package will be deprecated. For more information, see [Migrating to RabbitMQ .NET Client 7.x](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/blob/main/v7-MIGRATION.md).

### Add RabbitMQ client

In the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your client-consuming project, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireRabbitMQExtensions.AddRabbitMQClient%2A> extension method on any <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> to register an `IConnection` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddRabbitMQClient(connectionName: "messaging");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the RabbitMQ server resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Add RabbitMQ server resource](#add-rabbitmq-server-resource).

You can then retrieve the `IConnection` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IConnection connection)
{
    // Use connection...
}
```

For more information on dependency injection, see [.NET dependency injection](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection).

### Add keyed RabbitMQ client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `IConnection` instances with different connection names. To register keyed RabbitMQ clients, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireRabbitMQExtensions.AddKeyedRabbitMQClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedRabbitMQClient(name: "chat");
builder.AddKeyedRabbitMQClient(name: "queue");
```

Then you can retrieve the `IConnection` instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("chat")] IConnection chatConnection,
    [FromKeyedServices("queue")] IConnection queueConnection)
{
    // Use connections...
}
```

For more information on keyed services, see [.NET dependency injection: Keyed services](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Configuration

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration provides multiple options to configure the connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireRabbitMQExtensions.AddRabbitMQClient*> method:

```csharp
builder.AddRabbitMQClient(connectionName: "messaging");
```

Then the connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "messaging": "amqp://username:password@localhost:5672"
  }
}
```

For more information on how to format this connection string, see the [RabbitMQ URI specification docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html).

#### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration>. It loads the <xref:Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.RabbitMQClientSettings> from configuration by using the `Aspire:RabbitMQ:Client` key. The following snippet is an example of a _:::no-loc text="appsettings.json":::_ file that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "RabbitMQ": {
      "Client": {
        "ConnectionString": "amqp://username:password@localhost:5672",
        "DisableHealthChecks": true,
        "DisableTracing": true,
        "MaxConnectRetryCount": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete RabbitMQ client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client/ConfigurationSchema.json).

#### Use named configuration

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration supports named configuration, which allows you to configure multiple instances of the same resource type with different settings. The named configuration uses the connection name as a key under the main configuration section.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "RabbitMQ": {
      "Client": {
        "rabbit1": {
          "ConnectionString": "amqp://username:password@rabbit1:5672",
          "DisableHealthChecks": true,
          "MaxConnectRetryCount": 2
        },
        "rabbit2": {
          "ConnectionString": "amqp://username:password@rabbit2:5672",
          "DisableTracing": true,
          "MaxConnectRetryCount": 5
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `rabbit1` and `rabbit2` connection names can be used when calling `AddRabbitMQClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddRabbitMQClient("rabbit1");
builder.AddRabbitMQClient("rabbit2");
```

Named configuration takes precedence over the top-level configuration. If both are provided, the settings from the named configuration override the top-level settings.

#### Use inline delegates

Also you can pass the `Action<RabbitMQClientSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to disable health checks from code:

```csharp
builder.AddRabbitMQClient(
    "messaging",
    static settings => settings.DisableHealthChecks = true);
```

You can also set up the [IConnectionFactory](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/api/RabbitMQ.Client.IConnectionFactory.html) using the `Action<IConnectionFactory> configureConnectionFactory` delegate parameter of the `AddRabbitMQClient` method. For example to set the client provided name for connections:

```csharp
builder.AddRabbitMQClient(
    "messaging",
    configureConnectionFactory:
        static factory => factory.ClientProvidedName = "MyApp");
```

### Client integration health checks

By default, .NET Aspire integrations enable [health checks](../fundamentals/health-checks.md) for all services. For more information, see [.NET Aspire integrations overview](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md).

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration:

- Adds the health check when <xref:Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.RabbitMQClientSettings.DisableHealthChecks?displayProperty=nameWithType> is `false`, which attempts to connect to and create a channel on the RabbitMQ server.
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic.

### Observability and telemetry

.NET Aspire integrations automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as *the pillars of observability*. For more information about integration observability and telemetry, see [.NET Aspire integrations overview](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md). Depending on the backing service, some integrations might only support some of these features. For example, some integrations support logging and tracing, but not metrics. Telemetry features can also be disabled using the techniques presented in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

#### Logging

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration uses the following log categories:

- `RabbitMQ.Client`

#### Tracing

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration emits the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client`

#### Metrics

The .NET Aspire RabbitMQ integration currently doesn't support metrics by default.
