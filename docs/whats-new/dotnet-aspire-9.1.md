# What's new in .NET Aspire 9.1

üì¢ .NET Aspire 9.1 is the next minor version release of .NET Aspire; it supports _both_:

- .NET 8.0 Long Term Support (LTS) _or_
- .NET 9.0 Standard Term Support (STS).

> [!NOTE]
> You're able to use .NET Aspire 9.1 with either .NET 8 or .NET 9!

As always, we focused on highly requested features and pain points from the community. Our theme for 9.1 was "polish, polish, polish"‚Äîso you see quality of life fixes throughout the whole platform. Some highlights from this release are resource relationships in the dashboard, support for working in GitHub Codespaces, and publishing resources as a Dockerfile.

If you have feedback, questions, or want to contribute to .NET Aspire, collaborate with us on [:::image type="icon" source="../media/github-mark.svg" border="false"::: GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire) or join us on [:::image type="icon" source="../media/discord-icon.svg" border="false"::: Discord](https://discord.com/invite/h87kDAHQgJ) to chat with team members.

## Upgrade to .NET Aspire 9.1

Moving between minor releases of .NET Aspire is simple:

1. In your app host project file (that is, _MyApp.AppHost.csproj_), update the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version to `9.1.0`:

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

        <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.1.0" />
        
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    
    </Project>
    ```

1. Check for any NuGet package updates, either using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the **Update NuGet Package** command in VS Code.
1. Update to the latest .NET Aspire templates by running the following .NET command line:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new update
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `dotnet new update` command updates all of your templates to the latest version.

If your app host project file doesn't have the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` reference, you might still be using .NET Aspire 8. To upgrade to 9.1, you can follow [the documentation from last release](../get-started/upgrade-to-aspire-9).

## Dashboard UX and customization

With every release of .NET Aspire, the [dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md) gets more powerful and customizable.

### Resource relationships

The dashboard now reflects the concept of a "parent" and "child" resource relationship. For example, if you create a Postgres instance with multiple databases, they're now be nested in the **Resource** page in the same instance.

### Localization overrides

The dashboard defaults to the language set in your browser. This release introduces the ability to override this setting and change the dashboard language independently from the browser language. Consider the following screen capture, that demonstrates the addition of the language dropdown in the dashboard:

### Filtering

You can now filter what you see in the **Resource** page by **Resource type**, **State**, and **Health state**. Consider the following screen capture, which demonstrates the addition of the filter options in the dashboard:

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-filter.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-filter.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard showing the new filter options.":::

### More resource details

When you select a resource in the dashboard, more data points are now available in the details pane, including **References**, **Back references**, and **Volumes** with their mount types.

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-resourcedetails.png" lightbox="media/dashboard-resourcedetails.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire dashboard with references and back references showing.":::

### CORS support for custom local domains

You can now set the `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to allow the dashboard to receive telemetry from other browser apps, such as if you have resources running on custom localhost domains.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire app host: Dashboard configuration](../app-host/configuration.md#dashboard).

### Flexibility with console logs

The console log page has two new options. You're now able to download your logs so you can view them in your own diagnostics tools. Plus, you can turn timestamps on or off to reduce visual clutter when needed.

:::image type="content" source="media/consolelogs-download.png" lightbox="media/consolelogs-download.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the console logs page with the download button, turn off timestamps button, and logs that don't show timestamps.":::

### Various UX improvements

Several new features in .NET Aspire 9.1 enhance and streamline popular tasks:

- Resource commands, such as **Start** and **Stop** buttons, are now available on the **Console logs** page.
- Single selection to open in the _text visualizer_.
- URLs within logs are now automatically clickable, with commas removed from endpoints.

Additionally, the scrolled position now resets when switching between different resources.

## Local dev

### Start resources on demand

You can now tell resources not to start with the rest of your app by using `WithExplicitStart()` on the resource in your app host. Then, you can start it whenever you're ready from inside the dashboard.

For more information, see [Configure explicit resource start](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#configure-explicit-resource-start).

### Better Docker integration

The `PublishAsDockerfile()` feature was introduced for all projects and executable resources. This enhancement allows for complete customization of the Docker container and Dockerfile used during the publish process.

### Cleaning up Docker networks

In 9.1, we addressed a persistent issue where Docker networks created by .NET Aspire would remain active even after the application was stopped. This bug, tracked in [issue #6504](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6504), is resolved. Now, Docker networks are properly cleaned up, ensuring a more efficient and tidy development environment.

## Integrations

.NET Aspire thrives on [its integrations](../fundamentals/integrations-overview.md) with other platforms. This release has numerous updates to existing integrations, and details about migrations of ownership.

### Azure Cosmos DB, SignalR, Functions, and more

This release also focused on improving various [Azure integrations](../azure/integrations-overview.md):

- The Azure Cosmos DB integration now supports Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and supports the [vnext-preview emulator](/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-linux).
- Service Bus and SignalR resources now let you `RunAsEmulator()`
- It's simpler to connect to existing Azure resources in the app host
- Experimental support for configuring custom domains in Azure Container Apps.

### Even more integration updates

- OpenAI now supports [üì¶ Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.AI) NuGet package.
- RabbitMQ was updated to v7, and MongoDB was updated to v3. These client integration updates introduced breaking changes. A decision was made to release them as new packages, with the specific version number in the package name as a suffix, while the nonsuffixed packages continue to use the previous versions:
  - [üì¶ Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.RabbitMQ.Client.v7) NuGet package.
  - [üì¶ Aspire.MongoDB.Driver.v3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.MongoDB.Driver.v3) NuGet package.
- Dapr migrated to the [CommunityToolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire/tree/main/src/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Dapr) to allow it to innovate faster.
- Many other integrations got updates, fixes, and new features. Check out our [GitHub release](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/releases) for details and more!

The [üì¶ Aspire.Hosting.AWS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.AWS) NuGet package and source code migrated under [AWS ownership](https://github.com/aws/integrations-on-dotnet-aspire-for-aws). This migration happened as part of .NET Aspire 9.0, we're just restating that change here.

## Deployment

Significant improvements to the Azure Container Apps (ACA) deployment process can be found in 9.1, enhancing both the `azd` CLI and app host options. One of the most requested features‚Äîsupport for deploying npm applications to ACA‚Äîis now implemented. This new capability allows npm applications to be deployed to ACA just like other resources, streamlining the deployment process and providing greater flexibility for developers.

## Upgrade today
