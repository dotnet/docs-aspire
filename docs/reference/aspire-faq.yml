    questions:
      - question: |
          When will .NET Aspire be released?
        answer: |
          .NET Aspire is now in its preview release phase, with monthly updates expected until the product reaches general availability (GA). The official release is planned for the first half of 2024. Stay updated by checking the [official .NET Aspire repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire) for more information.
      - question: |
          What's the difference between .NET Aspire and Microsoft Orleans?
        answer: |
          Microsoft Orleans and .NET Aspire are complementary technologies.

          [Orleans](/dotnet/orleans) is a distributed actor-based framework. .NET Aspire is a cloud-ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications. It includes local orchestration capabilities to simplify the developer inner loop and reusable opinionated components for integrating with commonly used application dependencies. An Orleans-based solution will still have external dependencies such as data stores and caches for which .NET Aspire can be used for orchestration purposes.

          We are planning to produce a sample for .NET Aspire that uses Microsoft Orleans, see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/issues/20).
      - question: |
          What's the difference between .NET Aspire and Dapr?
        answer: |
          Dapr and .NET Aspire are complementary technologies.

          Where Dapr abstracts some of the underlying cloud platform, .NET Aspire provides opinionated configuration around the underlying cloud technologies without abstracting them. A .NET-based application that uses Dapr can use .NET Aspire to orchestrate the local developer inner loop and streamline deployment. .NET Aspire includes extensions that support the launching for Dapr side-car processes during the inner loop.
      - question: |
          What's the difference between .NET Aspire and Project Tye?
        answer: |
          Project Tye was an experiment which explored the launching and orchestration of micro-services and support
          deployment into orchestrators such as Kubernetes. .NET Aspire is a superset of Tye which includes the
          orchestration and deployment capabilities along with opinionated components for integrating common
          cloud-native dependencies. .NET Aspire can be considered the the evolution of the Project Tye experiment.
      - question: |
          What's the relationship between .NET Aspire and the Azure SDK for .NET?
        answer: |
          .NET Aspire provides components that rely on the [Azure SDK for .NET](/dotnet/azure/intro), to expose common functionality for storage ([Azure Blob Storage](../storage/azure-storage-blobs-component.md), [Azure Storage Queues](../storage/azure-storage-queues-component.md), and [Azure Table Storage](../storage/azure-storage-tables-component.md)), databases ([Azure Cosmos DB](../database/azure-cosmos-db-component.md) and [Azure Cosmos DB with Entity Framework Core](../database/azure-cosmos-db-entity-framework-component.md)), [messaging](../messaging/azure-service-bus-component.md), and [security](../security/azure-security-key-vault-component.md).
      - question: |
          Are worker services supported in .NET Aspire?
        answer: |
          Due to a deployment related bug, preview 1 of .NET Aspire doesn't support deployment of worker services.

          As a work around consider deploying a web application as a worker which is not exposed to the internet. We are currently tracking this issue and plan to have it resolved for preview 2 (see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/743)).
      - question: |
          Are Azure Functions supported in .NET Aspire?
        answer: |
          We have no specific support for Azure Functions in preview 1 of .NET Aspire however it's a target
          execution environment for deployment that we are planning to support in future previews.
