Aspire supports a local and global settings file. Settings defined in a local settings file override those set in the global settings file.

- **Local settings**

  A local settings file is stored at `.aspire/settings.json` under the current directory.

- **Global settings**

  The global settings file is stored at `$HOME/.aspire/settings.json`.
