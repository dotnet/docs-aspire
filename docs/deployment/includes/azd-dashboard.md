## Deploy the .NET Aspire Dashboard

You can deploy the .NET Aspire dashboard as part of your hosted app. This feature is now fully supported. When deploying, the azd output logs print an additional URL to the deployed dashboard.

You can run `azd monitor` to automatically launch the dashboard.

```azdeveloper
azd monitor
```
