# Deploy an Aspire project to Azure Container Apps using Aspire CLI

The [`aspire deploy`](../../cli-reference/aspire-deploy.md) CLI command provides a streamlined way to deploy Aspire applications directly to Azure Container Apps. This command automates the entire deployment process, from building container images to provisioning Azure infrastructure and deploying your applications. This article walks you through using the `aspire deploy` command to deploy an Aspire solution to Container Apps. You'll learn how to complete the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Use the `aspire deploy` command to deploy to Container Apps.
> - Validate Azure CLI authentication for deployment.
> - Provision Azure infrastructure using Bicep templates.
> - Build and push container images to Azure Container Registry.
> - Deploy compute resources to Container Apps.
> - Monitor deployment progress and access the deployed application.

[!INCLUDE [aspire-prereqs](../../includes/aspire-prereqs.md)]

Before using the `aspire deploy` command, ensure you have the following:

- **Azure CLI**: Installed and authenticated with your Azure account.
- **Docker**: Installed for building container images.
- **Azure subscription**: With appropriate permissions to create resources.

## Enable the deploy command

The `aspire deploy` command is currently in preview and disabled by default. To enable it:

```Aspire
aspire config set features.deployCommandEnabled true
```

## Authenticate with Azure

Before deploying, you must authenticate with Azure CLI. Run the following command:

```azurecli
az login
```

This command opens a web browser for you to sign in with your Azure credentials. The `aspire deploy` command automatically validates your Azure CLI authentication before proceeding with deployment. For more information, see:

- [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
- [The `aspire deploy` command reference](/dotnet/aspire/cli-reference/aspire-deploy).

## Create an Aspire project

As a starting point, this article assumes you've created an Aspire project from the **Aspire Starter Application** template. For more information, see [Quickstart: Build your first Aspire project](../../get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app.md).

To configure your project for Azure Container Apps deployment, add a package reference to your AppHost project that includes the [`📦Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers) NuGet package:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.5.1" />

    <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <UserSecretsId>7b352f08-305b-4032-9a21-90deb02efc04</UserSecretsId>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.5.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers" Version="9.5.1" />
    </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

In your AppHost project's _AppHost.cs_ file, add the Container Apps environment:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add Azure Container Apps environment
var containerAppEnv = builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("aspire-env");

// Add your services
var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(cache)
    .WithReference(apiService);

builder.Build().Run();
```

For more information, see [Configure Azure Container Apps environments](../../azure/configure-aca-environments.md).

### Resource naming

[!INCLUDE [azure-container-app-naming](../../includes/azure-container-app-naming.md)]

## Deploy with aspire deploy

Once your project is configured, deploy it using the `aspire deploy` command:

```Aspire
aspire deploy
```

> [!TIP]
> The `aspire deploy` command is interactive by default. To deploy without prompts, set these environment variables first:
>
> - `Azure__SubscriptionId`: Target Azure subscription ID.
> - `Azure__Location`: Azure region (for example, `eastus`).
> - `Azure__ResourceGroup`: Resource group name to create or reuse.

You can also specify additional options:

```Aspire
aspire deploy --project ./MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj
```

## Deployment process

The `aspire deploy` command performs the following steps automatically. First, the command validates that you're authenticated with Azure CLI. If you're not logged in, you'll see an error message prompting you to run `az login`.

Next, Aspire prompts you for the Azure subscription, location, and resource group name that the deployment should be targeted to. The subscriptions and locations that are accessible depend on the Azure account that is authenticated with the Azure CLI from the step above.

Next, Aspire analyzes your application model and prompts for any required deployment parameters that don't have values set. You'll see prompts like:

```Output
There are unresolved parameters that need to be set. Please provide values for them. [y/n] (n): y
Please provide values for the unresolved parameters. Parameters can be saved to user secrets for future use.
weatherApiKey: 
Save to user secrets: [y/n] (n): n
```

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI will continuously prompt until all unresolved parameters are provided with values. While Azure deployment is in preview, the CLI will prompt to save values in user secrets but not use them, as [deployment state is not supported](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/11444).

Once parameters are collected, Azure infrastructure is provisioned using Bicep templates. This step creates the necessary Azure resources including the Container Apps environment, Container Registry, and any backing services like Redis caches:

```Output
Step 3: Deploying Azure resources

    ✓ DONE: Deploying aca-env                              00:01:08
        Successfully provisioned aca-env
    ✓ DONE: Deploying storage                              00:00:04
        Successfully provisioned storage
    ✓ DONE: Deploying cosmosdb                             00:01:08
        Successfully provisioned cosmosdb
    ✓ DONE: Deploying apiservice-identity                  00:00:03
        Successfully provisioned apiservice-identity
    ✓ DONE: Deploying apiservice-roles-storage             00:00:11
        Successfully provisioned apiservice-roles-storage
    ✓ DONE: Deploying apiservice-roles-cosmosdb            00:01:10
        Successfully provisioned apiservice-roles-cosmosdb
```

After infrastructure provisioning, your application projects are built as container images and pushed to Azure Container Registry.

```Output
Step 4: Building container images for resources

    ✓ DONE: Checking Docker health               00:00:00
        Docker is healthy.
    ✓ DONE: Building image: apiservice           00:00:04
        Building image for apiservice completed
    ✓ DONE: Building image: webfrontend          00:00:05
        Building image for webfrontend completed

✅ COMPLETED: Building container images completed

Step 5: Authenticating to container registries

    ✓ DONE: Logging in to acrname         00:00:08
        Successfully logged in to acrname

✅ COMPLETED: Successfully authenticated to 1 container registries

Step 6: Pushing 2 images to container registries

    ✓ DONE: Pushing apiservice to acrname                                                              00:00:04
        Successfully pushed apiservice to acrname.azurecr.io/apiservice:aspire-deploy-20250922203320
    ✓ DONE: Pushing webfrontend to acrname                                                             00:00:04
        Successfully pushed webfrontend to acrname.azurecr.io/webfrontend:aspire-deploy-20250922203320

✅ COMPLETED: Successfully pushed 2 images to container registries
```

Finally, all .NET projects that were built as container images from the previous step, are pushed to provisioned Azure Container Registry—where they'll live, making them available to Container Apps:

```Output
Step 7: Deploying compute resources

    ✓ DONE: Deploying apiservice                                                                                   00:00:35
        Successfully deployed apiservice to https://apiservice.proudplant-5c457a5d.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io
    ✓ DONE: Deploying webfrontend                                                                                  00:00:19
        Successfully deployed webfrontend to https://webfrontend.proudplant-5c457a5d.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io

✅ COMPLETED: Successfully deployed 2 compute resources
```

Upon successful deployment, you'll see the Aspire dashboard URL where you can monitor and manage your deployed application:

```Output
✅ Deployment completed successfully. View Aspire dashboard at https://aspire-env.proudwater-12345678.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
```

For more information on what options are available on the `aspire deploy` command and examples of how to supply them on the CLI, see the [`aspire deploy` command reference](../../cli-reference/aspire-deploy.md).

## Monitor deployment

During deployment, you can monitor progress through:

1. **Console output**: Real-time progress updates and status messages.
1. **Azure portal**: View resources being created in your resource group.
1. **Azure CLI**: Use `az containerapp list` to see deployed applications.

## Troubleshooting deployment

When using the `aspire deploy` command, you may encounter various issues during deployment. Use this section to learn common problems and we provide you with tips for troubleshooting, helping you quickly identify and fix errors. With the right approach and understanding of common issues, you can ensure a smoother deployment process.

### Authentication issues

If you encounter authentication errors:

```bash
❌ Azure CLI authentication failed. Please run 'az login' to authenticate before deploying.
```

Run `az login` and ensure you have the necessary permissions in your Azure subscription. For more information, see [Sign in with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

### Resource naming conflicts

If resource names conflict with existing Azure resources, modify your resource names in the AppHost:

```csharp
var containerAppEnv = builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment(
        "my-unique-env-name"
    );
```

### Container build failures

If container builds fail, ensure:

- Docker is running and accessible.
- Your project builds successfully locally: `dotnet build`.
- Container runtime is properly configured.

## Access your deployed application

After successful deployment:

1. **Aspire Dashboard**: Access the dashboard URL provided in the deployment output.
1. **Application endpoints**: Find your application URLs in the Azure portal under Container Apps.
1. **Azure CLI**: List endpoints using:

   ```azurecli
   az containerapp show --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn
   ```

## Clean up resources

To remove deployed resources, delete the resource group:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <resource-group-name>
```
