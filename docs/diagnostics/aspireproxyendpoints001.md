## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001`:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis($"example-redis", 1234)
                   .WithEndpointProxySupport(false);
```

  ```ini
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREPROXYENDPOINTS001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```
