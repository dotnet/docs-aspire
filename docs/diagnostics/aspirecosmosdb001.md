Both `RunAsPreviewEmulator` and `WithDataExplorer` are considered experimental APIs.

Aspire provides a way to use the Cosmos DB Linux-based (preview) emulator and data explorer. These APIs are considered experimental and are expected to change in the future.

## Example

The following sample generates `ASPIRECOSMOSDB001`:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cosmos = builder.AddAzureCosmosDB("cosmos")
                    .RunAsPreviewEmulator(e => e.WithDataExplorer());
```

## To correct this error

Suppress the Error with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIRECOSMOSDB001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIRECOSMOSDB001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIRECOSMOSDB001` directive.
