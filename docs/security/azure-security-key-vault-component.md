# .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component

In this article, you learn how to use the .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component. The `Aspire.Azure.Key.Vault` component library is used to register a <xref:Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets.SecretClient> in the DI container for connecting to Azure Key Vault. It also enables corresponding health checks, logging and telemetry.

## Get started

To get started with the .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component, install the [Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault) NuGet package.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault --prerelease
```

### [PackageReference](#tab/package-reference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault"
                  Version="[SelectVersion]" />
```

---

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

## Example usage

In the _Program.cs_ file of your project, call the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireKeyVaultExtensions.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets%2A> extension to register a `SecretClient` for use via the dependency injection container.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets("secrets");
```

You can then retrieve the <xref:Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets.SecretClient> instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the client from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(SecretClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

## Configuration

The .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component provides multiple options to configure the `SecretClient` based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

### Use configuration providers

The .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component supports <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration?displayProperty=fullName>. It loads the <xref:Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault.AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings> from _appsettings.json_ or other configuration files using `Aspire:Azure:Security:KeyVault` key.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Security": {
        "KeyVault": {
          "VaultUri": "YOUR_VAULT_URI",
          "HealthChecks": true,
          "Tracing": false,
          "ClientOptions": {
            "DisableChallengeResourceVerification": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you have set up your configurations in the `Aspire:Azure:Security:KeyVault` section of your _appsettings.json_ file you can just call the method `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets` without passing any parameters.

### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings>` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to set the `Namespace`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets(
    "secrets",
    static settings => settings.ServiceUri = new Uri("YOUR_SERVICEURI"));
```

You can also set up the <xref:Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets.SecretClientOptions> using `Action<IAzureClientBuilder<SecretClient, SecretClientOptions>>` delegate, the second parameter of the `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets` method. For example to set the <xref:Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys.KeyClientOptions.DisableChallengeResourceVerification?displayProperty=nameWithType> ID to identify the client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets(
    "secrets",
    static clientBuilder =>
        clientBuilder.ConfigureOptions(
            static options => options.DisableChallengeResourceVerification = true))
```

### Named instances

If you want to add more than one `SecretClient` you can use named instances. Load the named configuration section from the json config by calling the `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets` method and passing in the `INSTANCE_NAME`.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets("INSTANCE_NAME");
```

The corresponding configuration JSON is defined as follows:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Security": {
        "KeyVault": {
          "INSTANCE_NAME": {
            "VaultUri": "YOUR_VAULT_URI",
            "HealthChecks": true,
            "Tracing": false,
            "ClientOptions": {
              "DisableChallengeResourceVerification": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration options

The following configurable options are exposed through the <xref:Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault.AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings> class:

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `VaultUri` | A URI to the vault on which the client operates. Appears as "DNS Name" in the Azure portal. |
| `Credential` | The credential used to authenticate to the Azure Key Vault. |
| `HealthChecks` | A boolean value that indicates whether the Key Vault health check is enabled or not. |
| `Tracing` | A boolean value that indicates whether the OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled or not. |

[!INCLUDE [component-health-checks](../includes/component-health-checks.md)]

The .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component includes the following health checks:

- Adds the `AzureKeyVaultSecretsHealthCheck` health check, which attempts to connect to and query the Key Vault
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic

[!INCLUDE [component-observability-and-telemetry](../includes/component-observability-and-telemetry.md)]

### Logging

The .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component uses the following log categories:

- Azure.Core
- Azure.Identity

### Tracing

The .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets.SecretClient

### Metrics

The .NET Aspire Azure Key Vault component currently does not support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK.
