# What is Aspire CLI configuration?

The Aspire CLI uses a configuration file to control its behavior. You can configure feature flags to enable or disable CLI features, and specify which AppHost project the CLI should use by default for an Aspire solution.

The settings file is stored in a `.aspire` folder and is named `settings.json`. Settings files can be stored locally or globally.

The following snippet is an example `.aspire/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "appHostPath": "../AspireShop/AspireShop.AppHost/AspireShop.AppHost.csproj",
  "features": {
    "deployCommandEnabled": "true"
  }
}
```

## Config file locations

A global Aspire CLI settings file is stored at `$HOME/.aspire/settings.json`, and is used as the default settings for the CLI. A local settings file overwrites the settings from the global file. Local settings files are stored at `./.aspire/settings.json`.

## Generating a config file

The CLI automatically generates a local settings file when you run a command that requires interaction with the AppHost, or if you set a config option. For example, `aspire run` searches for an AppHost project, and when found, generates the `./.aspire/settings.json` file with the `appHostPath` setting set to the project it found.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `appHostPath` can be set globally, but the CLI ignores it and only reads it in the local settings file.

## Settings

The Aspire CLI supports two categories of configuration settings:

- **Feature flags**\
These settings enable or disable specific CLI features. All feature flag setting names start with `feature.`

- **CLI behavior**\
These settings control how the CLI operates. Currently, the only CLI behavior setting is `appHostPath`, which specifies the location of the AppHost project.

The following table lists the settings that can be set in the config file:
