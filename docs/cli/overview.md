# .NET Aspire CLI Overview

// TODO: More selling of why you want to use this instead of the .NET CLI you're probably already familiar with.

The .NET Aspire CLI (`aspire` command) is a .NET global tool that provides command-line functionality to create, manage, run, and publish Aspire projects. Use the .NET Aspire CLI to streamline development workflows for distributed applications.

- [Install .NET Aspire CLI](install.md)

## Create projects

The `aspire new` command creates one or more Aspire projects that the Aspire CLI tool installs the latest Aspire project templates into the `dotnet` system.

Use the `aspire new` command to create an Aspire project from a list of templates. Once a template is selected, the name of the project is set, and the output folder is chosen, `aspire` downloads the latest templates and generates one or more projects.

## Run the app host project

// TODO: This also checks certs, and does it do anything else? What else should we point out?

The `aspire run` command runs the app host project in development mode, which launches the dashboard and any projects configured with the app host. This is similar to running the app host project in your IDE of choice, however, a terminal dashboard is also visible. For example:

```aspire

Press CTRL-C to stop the app host and exit.
```

## Add integrations

The `aspire add` command is an easy way to add integration packages to your app host. Use this as an alternative to a NuGet search through your IDE. You can run `aspire add <name|id>` if you know the name or NuGet ID of the integration package, If you omit a name or ID, the tool provides a list of packages to choose from. If you provide a partial name or ID, the tool filters the list of packages with items that match the provided value.

## Publish Aspire applications
