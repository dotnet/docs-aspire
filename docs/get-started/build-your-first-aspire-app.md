# Quickstart: Build your first .NET Aspire app

Cloud-native apps often require connections to various services such as databases, storage and caching solutions, messaging providers, or other web services. .NET Aspire is designed to streamline connections and configurations between these types of services. In this quickstart, you learn how to create a .NET Aspire Starter Application template solution.

In this quickstart, you explore the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a basic .NET app that is set up to use .NET Aspire.
> - Add and configure a .NET Aspire component to implement caching.
> - Create an API and use service discovery to connect to it.
> - Orchestrate communication between a front end UI, a back end API, and a local Redis cache.

[!INCLUDE [aspire-prereqs](../includes/aspire-prereqs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [file-new-aspire](../includes/file-new-aspire.md)]

The solution consists of the following projects:

- **AspireSample.ApiService**: An ASP.NET Core Minimal API project is used to provide data to the front end. This project depends on the shared **AspireSample.ServiceDefaults** project.
- **AspireSample.AppHost**: An orchestrator project designed to connect and configure the different projects and services of your app. The orchestrator should be set as the _Startup project_, and it depends on the **AspireSample.ApiService** and **AspireSample.Web** projects.
- **AspireSample.ServiceDefaults**: A .NET Aspire shared project to manage configurations that are reused across the projects in your solution related to [resilience](/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience), [service discovery](../service-discovery/overview.md), and [telemetry](../fundamentals/telemetry.md).
- **AspireSample.Web**: An ASP.NET Core Blazor App project with default .NET Aspire service configurations, this project depends on the **AspireSample.ServiceDefaults** project. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service defaults](../fundamentals/service-defaults.md).

Your _AspireSample_ directory should resemble the following:

[!INCLUDE [template-directory-structure](../includes/template-directory-structure.md)]

## Explore the starter projects

Each project in an .NET Aspire solution plays a role in the composition of your app. The _*.Web_ project is a standard ASP.NET Core Blazor App that provides a front end UI. For more information, see [New Blazor Web App template](/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-8.0?view=aspnetcore-8.0&preserve-view=true#new-blazor-web-app-template). The _*.ApiService_ project is a standard ASP.NET Core Minimal API template project. Both of these projects depend on the _*.ServiceDefaults_ project, which is a shared project that's used to manage configurations that are reused across projects in your solution.

The two projects of interest in this quickstart are the _*.AppHost_ and _*.ServiceDefaults_ projects detailed in the following sections.

### .NET Aspire app host project

The _*.AppHost_ project is responsible for acting as the orchestrator, and sets the `IsAspireHost` property of the project file to `true`:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/quickstart/AspireSample/AspireSample.AppHost/AspireSample.AppHost.csproj" highlight="8":::

Consider the _Program.cs_ file of the _AspireSample.AppHost_ project:

:::code source="snippets/quickstart/AspireSample/AspireSample.AppHost/Program.cs":::

If you've used either the [.NET Generic Host](/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host) or the [ASP.NET Core Web Host](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/web-host) before, the app host programming model and builder pattern should be familiar to you. The preceding code:

- Creates an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder> instance from calling <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- Calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RedisBuilderExtensions.AddRedisContainer%2A> with the name `"cache"` to add a Redis container to the app, assigning the returned value to a variable named `cache`, which is of type `IResourceBuilder<RedisContainerResource>`.
- Calls <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject%2A> given the generic-type parameter with the project's <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IServiceMetadata> details, adding the `AspireSample.ApiService` project to the application model. This is one of the fundamental building blocks of .NET Aspire, and it's used to configure service discovery and communication between the projects in your app. The name argument `"apiservice"` is used to identify the project in the application model, and used later by projects that want to communicate with it.
- Calls `AddProject` again, this time adding the `AspireSample.Web` project to the application model. It also chains multiple calls to <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReference%2A> passing the `cache` and `apiservice` variables. The `WithReference` API is another fundamental API of .NET Aspire, which injects either service discovery information or connection string configuration into the project being added to the application model.

Finally, the app is built and run. The <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication.Run?displayProperty=nameWithType> method is provided by the .NET Aspire SDK, and is responsible for starting the app and all of its dependencies. For more information, see [.NET Aspire orchestration overview](../fundamentals/app-host-overview.md).

### .NET Aspire service defaults project

The _*.ServiceDefaults_ project is a shared project that's used to manage configurations that are reused across the projects in your solution. This project ensures that all dependent services share the same resilience, service discovery, and OpenTelemetry configuration. A shared .NET Aspire project file contains the `IsAspireSharedProject` property set as `true`:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/quickstart/AspireSample/AspireSample.ServiceDefaults/AspireSample.ServiceDefaults.csproj" highlight="8":::

The service defaults project exposes an extension method on the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationBuilder> type, named `AddServiceDefaults`. The service defaults project from the template is a starting point, and you can customize it to meet your needs. For more information, see [.NET Aspire service defaults](../fundamentals/service-defaults.md).

## Orchestrate service communication

.NET Aspire provides orchestration features to assist with configuring connections and communication between the different parts of your app. The _AspireSample.AppHost_ project added the _AspireSample.ApiService_ and _AspireSample.Web_ projects to the application model. It also declared their names as `"webfrontend"` for Blazor front end, `"apiservice"` for the API project reference. Additionally, a Redis container resource labelled `"cache"` was added. These names are used to configure service discovery and communication between the projects in your app.

The front end app defines a typed <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> that's used to communicate with the API project.

:::code source="snippets/quickstart/AspireSample/AspireSample.Web/WeatherApiClient.cs":::

The `HttpClient` is configured to use service discovery, consider the following code from the _Program.cs_ file of the _AspireSample.Web_ project:

:::code source="snippets/quickstart/AspireSample/AspireSample.Web/Program.cs" highlight="7-8,14-15":::

The preceding code:

- Calls `AddServiceDefaults`, configuring the shared defaults for the app.
- Calls <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.AspireRedisOutputCacheExtensions.AddRedisOutputCache%2A> with the same `connectionName` that was used when adding the Redis container `"cache"` to the application model. This configures the app to use Redis for output caching.
- Calls <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HttpClientFactoryServiceCollectionExtensions.AddHttpClient%2A> and configures the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient.BaseAddress?displayProperty=nameWithType> to be `"http://apiservice"`. This is the name that was used when adding the API project to the application model, and with service discovery configured, it will automatically resolve to the correct address to the API project.

For more information, see [Make HTTP requests with the `HttpClient`](/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient) class.

## Test the app locally

The sample app is now ready for testing. You want to verify the following:

- Weather data is retrieved from the API project using service discovery and displayed on the weather page.
- Subsequent requests are handled via the output caching configured by the .NET Aspire Redis component.

### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

In Visual Studio, set the **AspireSample.AppHost** project as the startup project by right-clicking on the project in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Set as Startup Project**. Then, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run the app.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project AspireSample/AspireSample.AppHost
```

For more information, see [dotnet run](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run).

1. Navigate from the home page to the weather page in the browser. The page should load the weather data, make a mental note of some of the values represented in the forecast table.
1. Continue occasionally refreshing the page for 10 seconds. Within 10 seconds, the cached data is returned. Eventually, a different set of weather data appears, since the data is randomly generated and the cache is updated.

## Explore the .NET Aspire dashboard

When you run a .NET Aspire app, a dashboard also launches that you use to monitor various parts of your app. The dashboard should resemble the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="media/aspire-dashboard.png" lightbox="media/aspire-dashboard.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the .NET Aspire Dashboard, depicting the Projects tab.":::

Visit each link on the left navigation to view different information about the .NET Aspire app:

- **Projects**: Lists basic information for all of the individual .NET projects in your .NET Aspire app, such as the app state, endpoint addresses, and the environment variables that were loaded in.
- **Containers**: Lists basic information about your app containers, such as the state, image tag, and port number. You should see the Redis container you added for output caching with the name you provided.
- **Executables**: Lists the running executables used by your app. The sample app doesn't include any executables, so it should display the message **No running executables found**.
- **Logs**:

  - **Project**: Displays the output logs for the projects in your app. Select which project you'd like to display logs for using the drop-down at the top of the page.
  - **Container**: Displays logs from the containers in your app. You should see Redis logs from the container you configured as part of the template. If you have more than one container, you can select which to show logs from using the drop-down at the top of the page.
  - **Executable**: Displays logs from the executables in your app. The sample app doesn't include any executables, so there's nothing to see here.
  - **Structured**: Displays structured logs in table format. These logs support basic filtering, free-form search, and log level filtering as well. You should see logs from the `apiservice` and the `webfrontend`. You can expand the details of each log entry by selecting the **View** button on the right end of the row.

- **Traces**: Displays the traces for your application, which can track request paths through your apps. Locate a request for **/weather** and select **View** on the right side of the page. The dashboard should display the request in stages as it travels through the different parts of your app.

    :::image type="content" source="media/aspire-dashboard-trace.png" lightbox="media/aspire-dashboard-trace.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an .NET Aspire dashboard trace for the webfrontend /weather route.":::

- **Metrics**: Displays various instruments and meters that are exposed and their corresponding dimensions for your app. Metrics conditionally expose filters based on their available dimensions.
