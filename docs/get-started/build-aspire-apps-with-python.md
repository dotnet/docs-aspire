# Orchestrate Python apps in .NET Aspire

In this article, you learn how to use Python apps in a .NET Aspire project. The sample app in this article demonstrates launching a Python application. The Python extension for .NET Aspire requires the use of virtual environments.

[!INCLUDE [aspire-prereqs](../includes/aspire-prereqs.md)]

Additionally, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) on your machine. The sample app in this article was built with Python version 3.12.4 and pip version 24.1.2. To verify your Python and pip versions, run the following commands:

```python
python --version
```

```python
pip --version
```

To download Python (including `pip`), see the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Create a .NET Aspire project using the template

To get started launching a Python project in .NET Aspire first use the starter template to create a .NET Aspire application host:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new aspire -o PythonSample
```

In the same terminal session, change directories into the newly created project:

```dotnetcli
cd PythonSample
```

Once the template has been created launch the app host with the following command to ensure that the app host and the [.NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md) launches successfully:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj
```

Once the app host starts it should be possible to click on the dashboard link in the console output. At this point the dashboard will not show any resources. Stop the app host by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

## Prepare a Python project

From your previous terminal session where you created the .NET Aspire solution, create a new directory to contain the Python source code.

```Console
mkdir hello-python
```

Change directories into the newly created _hello-python_ directory:

```Console
cd hello-python
```

### Initialize the Python virtual environment

To work with Python projects, they need to be within a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```python
python -m venv .venv
```

For more information on virtual environments, see the [Python: Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

To activate the virtual environment, enabling installation and usage of packages, run the following command:

### [Unix/macOS](#tab/bash)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### [Windows](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

Ensure that pip within the virtual environment is up-to-date by running the following command:

```python
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Install Python packages

Install the Flask package by creating a _requirements.txt_ file in the _hello-python_ directory and adding the following line:

```python
Flask==3.0.3
```

Then, install the Flask package by running the following command:

```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After Flask is installed, create a new file named _main.py_ in the _hello-python_ directory and add the following code:

```python
import os
import flask

app = flask.Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8111))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

The preceding code creates a simple Flask app that listens on port 8111 and returns the message `"Hello, World!"` when the root endpoint is accessed.

## Update the app host project

Install the Python hosting package by running the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add ../PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj package Aspire.Hosting.Python --version 8.1.0
```

After the package is installed, the project XML should have a new package reference similar to the following:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="8.1.0" />

    <!-- Add this reference to PythonSample.AppHost.csproj -->
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Python" Version="8.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Update the app host _Program.cs_ file to include the Python project, by calling the `AddPythonProject` API and specifying the project name, project path, and the entry point file:

:::code source="snippets/PythonSample/PythonSample.AppHost/Program.cs":::

## Run the app

Now that you've added the Python hosting package, updated the app host _Program.cs_ file, and created a Python project, you can run the app host:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj
```

Launch the dashboard by clicking the link in the console output. The dashboard should display the Python project as a resource.

:::image source="media/python-dashboard.png" lightbox="media/python-dashboard.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Python sample app.":::

Select the **Endpoints** link to open the `hello-python` endpoint in a new browser tab. The browser should display the message "Hello, World!":

:::image source="media/python-hello-world.png" lightbox="media/python-hello-world.png" alt-text=".NET Aspire dashboard: Python sample app endpoint.":::

Stop the app host by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

## Add telemetry support.

To add a bit of observability, add telemetry to help monitor the dependant Python app. In the Python project, add the following OpenTelemetry package as a dependency in the _requirements.txt_ file:

:::code language="python" source="snippets/PythonSample/hello-python/requirements.txt" highlight="2":::

The preceding requirement update, adds the OpenTelemetry package and the OTLP exporter. Next, re-install the Python app requirements into the virtual environment by running the following command:

```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The preceding command installs the OpenTelemetry package and the OTLP exporter, in the virtual environment. Update the Python app to include the OpenTelemetry code, by replacing the existing _main.py_ code with the following:

:::code language="python" source="snippets/PythonSample/hello-python/main.py":::

Update the app host project's _launchSettings.json_ file to include the `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` environment variable:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/PythonSample/PythonSample.AppHost/Properties/launchSettings.json":::

The `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` variable is required because when running locally the OpenTelemetry client in Python rejects the local development certificate. Launch the _app host_ again:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project PythonSample.AppHost/PythonSample.AppHost.csproj
```

Once the app host has launched navigate to the dashboard and note that in addition to console log output, structured logging is also being routed through to the dashboard.

## Summary

While there are several considerations that are beyond the scope of this article, you learned how to build .NET Aspire solution that integrates with Python. You also learned how to use the `AddPythonProject` API to host Python apps.
