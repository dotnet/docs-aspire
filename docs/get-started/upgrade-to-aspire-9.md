# Upgrade to .NET Aspire 9

In this article, you learn the steps involved in updating your existing .NET Aspire 8 projects to .NET Aspire 9. There are a few ways in which you can update your projects to .NET Aspire 9:

- Manually upgrade your projects to .NET Aspire 9.0.
- Use the **Upgrade Assistant** to upgrade your projects to .NET Aspire 9.0.

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to .NET Aspire, there's no reason to upgrade anything. For more information, see [.NET Aspire setup and tooling](../fundamentals/setup-tooling.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you upgrade your projects to .NET Aspire 9.0, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Install the latest tooling](../fundamentals/setup-tooling.md).
- [Use the .NET Aspire SDK](../fundamentals/dotnet-aspire-sdk.md).
- If you have a version of .NET Aspire older than 9.0, [remove it](#upgrade-your-development-environment).

## Upgrade your development environment

Before you can use .NET Aspire 9, you need to remove outdated components and upgrade your tooling.

### .NET Aspire workload

Previously the **aspire workload** was required to create and run .NET Aspire projects. But, with .NET Aspire 9 the workload is no longer required and should be removed from your .NET environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must remove .NET Aspire 8 (the **aspire workload**) to enable the .NET Aspire 9 templates.

01. Find the installation source by opening a terminal and running the `dotnet workload list` command.

    The preceding command lists the workloads installed in the .NET environment. The method used to install .NET Aspire is listed under the **Installation Source** column of the output, and is either _VS_ for Visual Studio or _SDK_ for the .NET SDK. For example, the following snippet indicates that Visual Studio was used to install .NET Aspire:

    ```
    Installed Workload Id      Manifest Version      Installation Source
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    aspire                     8.2.2/8.0.100         VS 17.14.36109.1
    ```

01. Remove .NET Aspire 8.

    - If the **Installation Source** starts with _VS_:

      01. Open the **Visual Studio Installer** app.
      01. **Modify** the installation instance of Visual Studio.
      01. Select **Individual Components**.
      01. Search for `aspire`.
      01. Unselect **.NET Aspire SDK**.
      01. Select the **Modify** button to apply the changes.

    - If the **Installation Source** starts with _SDK_, run `dotnet workload uninstall aspire` to remove .NET Aspire.

01. Install the .NET Aspire 9.0 templates with the `dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates` command.

## Manually upgrade to .NET Aspire 9.0

To upgrade your projects to .NET Aspire 9.0, you need to update your project files. The following steps guide you through the process:

- Edit your [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project file to use the new .NET Aspire 9.0 SDK (`Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`).
- Update the NuGet packages in your project files to the latest versions.
- Adjust your _Program.cs_ file to use the new APIs and remove any obsolete APIs.

### Edit your app host project file

To upgrade your app host project to .NET Aspire 9.0, you need to update your project file to use the new [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk):

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

+  <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
    <UserSecretsId>0afc20a6-cd99-4bf7-aae1-1359b0d45189</UserSecretsId>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="8.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

### Optionally upgrade the target framework moniker (TFM)

.NET Aspire 9.0 runs on .NET 9.0, but you can also run it on .NET 8.0. In other words, just because you're using the .NET Aspire SDK, and pointing to version 9.0 packages, you can still target .NET 8.0. If you want to run your .NET Aspire 9.0 project on .NET 9.0, you need to update the `TargetFramework` property in your project file:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
-   <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
+   <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
    <UserSecretsId>0afc20a6-cd99-4bf7-aae1-1359b0d45189</UserSecretsId>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

For more information on TFMs, see [Target frameworks in SDK-style projects: Latest versions](/dotnet/standard/frameworks#latest-versions).

### Overall app host project differences

If you followed all of the preceding steps, your app host project file should look like this:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

+  <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
-   <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
+   <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
    <UserSecretsId>0afc20a6-cd99-4bf7-aae1-1359b0d45189</UserSecretsId>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
-   <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="8.0.0" />
+   <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

The changes include the addition of the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`, the update of the `TargetFramework` property to `net9.0`, and the update of the `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost` package to version `9.0.0`.

### Adjust your _Program.cs_ file

With the introduction of .NET Aspire 9.0, there are some _breaking changes_. Some APIs were originally marked as experimental (with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExperimentalAttribute>) and are now removed, while other APIs are now attributed as <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> with details on new replacement APIs. You need to adjust your _Program.cs_ file (and potentially other affected APIs) to use the new APIs. If you're using the Upgrade Assistant to upgrade your projects, it automatically adjusts your _Program.cs_ file in most cases.

For the complete list of breaking changes in .NET Aspire 9.0, see [Breaking changes in .NET Aspire 9.0](../compatibility/9.0/index.md).

## Use the Upgrade Assistant

The [Upgrade Assistant](/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) is a tool that helps upgrade targeted projects to the latest version. If you're new to the Upgrade Assistant, there's two modalities to choose from:

- [The Visual Studio extension version](/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-install#visual-studio-extension).
- [The .NET CLI global tool version](/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-install#net-global-tool).

Regardless of how you install the Upgrade Assistant, you can use it to upgrade your .NET Aspire 8.x projects to .NET Aspire 9.0.

### Update the NuGet packages

To take advantage of the latest updates in your .NET Aspire solution, update all NuGet packages to version `9.0.0`.

:::zone pivot="visual-studio"

:::image type="content" source="media/visual-studio-update-nuget.png" lightbox="media/visual-studio-update-nuget.png" alt-text="Visual Studio: Update all NuGet packages for the .NET Aspire solution.":::

:::zone-end
:::zone pivot="vscode,dotnet-cli"

To update your app host project, use the following .NET CLI command to update the `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost` package to version `9.0.0`:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.AppHost --version 9.0.0
```

When a package reference already exists, the `dotnet add package` command updates the reference to the specified version. For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package).

:::zone-end

With the app host project updated, your project file should look like this:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
    <UserSecretsId>0afc20a6-cd99-4bf7-aae1-1359b0d45189</UserSecretsId>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
-   <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="8.0.0" />
+   <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

> [!TIP]
> You'll want to also update the NuGet packages in your other projects to the latest versions.

## Verify the upgrade

As with any upgrade, ensure that the app runs as expected and that all tests pass. Build the solution and look for suggestions, warnings, or errors in the output windowâ€”address anything that wasn't an issue before. If you encounter any issues, let us know by [filing a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/new/choose).
