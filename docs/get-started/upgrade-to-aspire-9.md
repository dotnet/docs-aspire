## Manually upgrade to .NET Aspire 9.0

To upgrade your projects to .NET Aspire 9.0, you need to update your project files. The following steps will guide you through the process:

- Edit your [app host](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host) project file to use the new .NET Aspire 9.0 SDK (`Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`).
- Update the NuGet packages in your project files to the latest versions.
- Adjust your _Program.cs_ file to use the new API changes.

### Edit your app host project file

To upgrade your project to .NET Aspire 9.0, you need to update your project file to use the new .NET Aspire 9.0 SDK. Open your project file in a text editor and update the `Sdk` attribute to use the new [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
    <UserSecretsId>0afc20a6-cd99-4bf7-aae1-1359b0d45189</UserSecretsId>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.AppHost" Version="9.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

### Update the NuGet packages

Update the NuGet packages in your project files to the latest versions. You can use the following command to update the NuGet packages in your project:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.Hosting.AppHost --version 9.0.0
```

### Adjust your _Program.cs_ file

With the introduction of .NET Aspire 9.0, there are some breaking API changes. Some APIs were originally marked as experimental and are now removed, and/or replaced with new APIs. You need to adjust your _Program.cs_ file to use the new APIs.

The following table lists some of the APIs changes:

| .NET Aspire 8.x API | .NET Aspire 9.0 API |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `SomeOldApi`        | `SomeNewApi`        |

## Use the Upgrade Assistant

The [Upgrade Assistant](/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) is a tool that can help you update your projects to .NET Aspire 9.0.
