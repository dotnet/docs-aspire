## Example usage

To add the DbGate management UI to your Redis resource, call the `WithDbGate` method on the `RedisResource` instance.

```csharp
var redis = builder.AddRedis("Redis")
    .WithDbGate();
```

This will add a new resource to the app host which will be available from the .NET Aspire dashboard.
