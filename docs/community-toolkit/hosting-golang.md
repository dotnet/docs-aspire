In this article, you learn how to use the .NET Aspire Go hosting integration to host Go applications.

## Hosting integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Go hosting integration, install the [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.CommunityToolkit.Hosting.Go](https://dev.azure.com/dotnet/CommunityToolkit/_artifacts/feed/CommunityToolkit-MainLatest/NuGet/Aspire.CommunityToolkit.Hosting.Golang) NuGet package in the AppHost project.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Aspire.CommunityToolkit.Hosting.Golang

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

## Example usage

In the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your app host project, call the `AddGolangApp` method to add a Go application to the builder.

```csharp
var golang = builder.AddGolangApp("golang", "../go-service");
```

The Go application can be added as a reference to other resources in the AppHost project.
