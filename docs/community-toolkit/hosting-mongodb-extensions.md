## Example usage

To add the DbGate management UI to your MongoDB resource, call the `WithDbGate` method on the `MongoDBResourceBuilder` instance.

```csharp
var MongoDB = builder.AddMongoDB("MongoDB")
    .WithDbGate();
```

This will add a new resource to the AppHost which will be available from the .NET Aspire dashboard.
