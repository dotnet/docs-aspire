# .NET Aspire Community Toolkit

The .NET Aspire Community Toolkit is a collection of integrations and extensions for .NET Aspire created by the community. These integrations are not officially supported by the .NET Aspire team, but are provided as-is for the community to use and contribute to. The source code for the toolkit is available on [GitHub][repo].

[repo]: https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire "GitHub repository"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the purpose of this project?

The goal of the project is to be a centralised home for extensions and integrations for [.NET Aspire](/dotnet/aspire), helping to provide consistency in the way that integrations are built and maintained, as well as easier discoverability for users.

### How is this project different from the official .NET Aspire project?

The .NET Aspire Community Toolkit is a community-driven project that is maintained by the community and is not officially supported by the .NET Aspire team. The toolkit is a collection of integrations and extensions that are built on top of the .NET Aspire project.

### How can I contribute to the project?

Anyone can contribute to the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit and before you get started, be sure to read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to the project.

### Should I propose a new integration on the Community Toolkit or the `dotnet/aspire` repo?

If you have an idea for a new integration, you should propose it on the [.NET Aspire Community Toolkit repository][repo], rather than [`dotnet/aspire`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire), as the official .NET Aspire project is focused on the core functionality of the .NET Aspire project.

If you have previously proposed an integration on the `dotnet/aspire` repository, you can still propose it in the Community Toolkit, but link to the existing issue on the `dotnet/aspire` repository to provide context.

### Finding Community Toolkit Integrations

Integrations from the .NET Aspire Community Toolkit will appear in the "Add Aspire Integration" dialog in Visual Studio under the namespace `Aspire.CommunityToolkit.*`.
