## Example usage

To add the DbGate management UI to your MySql resource, call the `WithDbGate` method on the `MySqlServerResourceBuilder` instance.

```csharp
var mysql = builder.AddMySql("mysql")
    .WithDbGate();
```

To add the Adminer management UI to your MySql resource, call the `WithAdminer` method on the `MySqlServerResourceBuilder` instance.

```csharp
var mysql = builder.AddMySql("mysql")
    .WithAdminer();
```

This will add a new resource to the AppHost which will be available from the .NET Aspire dashboard.
