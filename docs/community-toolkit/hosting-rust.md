In this article, you learn how to use the .NET Aspire Rust hosting integration to host Rust applications.

## Hosting integration

To get started with the .NET Aspire Rust hosting integration, install the [ðŸ“¦ CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Rust](https://nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Rust) NuGet package in the AppHost project.

### [.NET CLI](#tab/dotnet-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Rust
```

```xml
<PackageReference Include="CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Rust"

For more information, see [dotnet add package](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) or [Manage package dependencies in .NET applications](/dotnet/core/tools/dependencies).

## Example usage

In the _:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::_ file of your app host project, call the `AddRustApp` method to add a Rust application to the builder.

```csharp
var rust = builder.AddRustApp("rust-app", "../rust-service");
```

The Rust application can be added as a reference to other resources in the AppHost project.
