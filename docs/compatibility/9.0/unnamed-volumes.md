# Updates to implicitly named volumes to avoid collisions

The `WithDataVolume` methods create container volumes with names implicitly based on the App Host project name and resource name. This can lead to collisions when multiple App Host projects share the same name.

## Version introduced

.NET Aspire 9.0 GA

## Previous behavior

The implicit volume name is based on the App Host project name and resource name. For example, if the App Host project is named "TestShop.AppHost" and the resource is named "postgres", the implicit volume name will be "TestShop.AppHost-postgres-data".

## New behavior

The implicit volume naming logic now includes a hash of the App Host project path or another deterministic, stable value derived from the App Host project. This prevents collisions of implicit volume names across different solutions.

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [behavioral change](../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Recommended action

Developers should review their usage of the `WithDataVolume` method and ensure that any custom volume names are unique to avoid collisions. If relying on implicit naming, verify that the new naming logic does not introduce any issues.

## Affected APIs

- `WithDataVolume`
