# Hybrid compute mode between azd and Aspire apps dropped

.NET Aspire 9.4 removes hybrid compute mode. In this mode, Azure Developer CLI (azd) creates the Azure Container Apps Environment, and .NET Aspire generates the individual Container App Bicep modules. Projects that rely on azd-owned environments must now model an `AzureContainerAppEnvironmentResource` inside the .NET Aspire application.

## Version introduced

.NET Aspire 9.4

## Previous behavior

You use `PublishAsAzureContainerApp()` to automatically connect to infrastructure that azd generates when you deploy:

```csharp
builder.AddContainer("api", "image")
       .PublishAsAzureContainerApp((infra, app) => { })     // ‚Üê automatically added infra
       .WithReference(db);
```

The `PublishAsAzureContainerApp()` method would automatically handle the connection to the Azure Container Apps Environment created by azd.

## New behavior

You must now explicitly add an Azure Container Apps Environment resource to your .NET Aspire application:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env");   // Required to target ACA
builder.AddContainer("api", "image")
       .WithReference(db);
```

The environment resource must be explicitly defined before you can deploy containers to Azure Container Apps.

## Type of breaking change

This is a [behavioral change](../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

The hybrid path created hidden coupling and ambiguity:

- Known-parameter substitution (Key Vault names, volume storage accounts, etc.) couldn't be resolved reliably when multiple compute environments existed.
- The change aligns .NET Aspire with the "compute-environment-as-resource" design and simplifies infrastructure generation logic.

## Recommended action

Add an environment resource to your .NET Aspire application using the `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment` method:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env");
```

This explicit declaration ensures that your application has a clear, unambiguous reference to the Azure Container Apps Environment.

## Affected APIs

- `PublishAsAzureContainerApp`
