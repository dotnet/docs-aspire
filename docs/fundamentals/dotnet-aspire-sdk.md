# .NET Aspire SDK

The .NET Aspire SDK is tailored for [_*.AppHost_ projects](app-host-overview.md), which serve as entry points for .NET Aspire app hosts (`<IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>`).

## Overview

The [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) is an additive [MSBuild project SDK](/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk) for building [.NET Aspire apps](../index.yml). The `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` is defined with a top-level `Project/Sdk`:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />
    
    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
        <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    </PropertyGroup>
    
    <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
</Project>
```

The preceding example project defines the top-level SDK as `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` and the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` as an additive SDK. The `IsAspireHost` property is set to `true` to indicate that this project is an .NET Aspire app host.

## SDK Features

The .NET Aspire SDK provides the following features:

- The `ProjectReferences` in the [.NET Aspire app host](app-host-overview.md) project aren't treated as project references. This feature enables the _app host_ to execute these projects instead as part of its orchestration. The project references are used to populate the named projects with the `static class Projects`, where each project is represented as an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IProjectMetadata>.
- Dynamically adds references to the [.NET Aspire dashboard](dashboard/overview.md) and other app host dependencies, such as, the developer control plane (DCP) packages. These dependencies are specific to the platform that the app host is built on.
