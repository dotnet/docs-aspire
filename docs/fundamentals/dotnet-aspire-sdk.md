# .NET Aspire SDK

The .NET Aspire SDK is tailored for [_*.AppHost_ projects](app-host-overview.md#app-host-project), which serve as the .NET Aspire orchestrator. These projects as designated using the `<IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>` property, as well as specifying the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` in the project file. The SDK provides a set of features that simplify the development of .NET Aspire apps.

## Overview

The [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) is an additive [MSBuild project SDK](/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk) for building [.NET Aspire apps](../index.yml). The `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` is defined with a top-level `Project/Sdk`:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <Sdk Name="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk" Version="9.0.0" />
    
    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
        <IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    </PropertyGroup>
    
    <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
</Project>
```

The preceding example project defines the top-level SDK as `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` and the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` as an additive SDK. The `IsAspireHost` property is set to `true` to indicate that this project is an .NET Aspire app host.

## SDK Features

The .NET Aspire SDK provides several key features.

### Project references

The `ProjectReferences` in the [.NET Aspire app host][app-host] project aren't treated as project references. This feature enables the _app host_ to execute these projects instead as part of its orchestration. The project references are used to populate the named projects with the `static class Projects`, where each project is represented as an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IProjectMetadata>.

If you have a need to reference a project within the app host, and you want to avoid this functionality, set the `IsAspireProjectResource` attribute on the `ProjectReference` element to `false`. Consider the following example:

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\MyProject\MyProject.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
```

### Orchestrator dependencies

The .NET Aspire SDK dynamically adds references to the [.NET Aspire dashboard](dashboard/overview.md) and other app host dependencies, such as, the developer control plane (DCP) packages. These dependencies are specific to the platform that the app host is built on.

When the app host project runs, the orchestrator relies on these dependencies to provide the necessary functionality to the app host. For more information, see [.NET Aspire orchestration overview][app-host].
