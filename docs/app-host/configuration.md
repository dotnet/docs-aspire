# App host configuration

The app host project configures and starts your distributed application (<xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication>). When a `DistributedApplication` runs it reads configuration from the app host. Configuration is loaded from environment variables that are set on the app host and <xref:Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplicationOptions>.

Configuration includes:

- Settings for hosting the resource service, such as the address and authentication options.
- Settings used to start the [.NET Aspire dashboard](../fundamentals/dashboard/overview.md), such the dashboard's frontend and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) addresses.
- Internal settings that .NET Aspire uses to run the app host. These are set internally but can be accessed by integrations that extend .NET Aspire.

App host configuration is provided by the app host launch profile. The app host has a launch settings file call _launchSettings.json_ which has a list of launch profiles. Each launch profile is a collection of related options which defines how you would like `dotnet` to start your application.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:17134;http://localhost:15170",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:21030",
        "DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:22057"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The preceding launch settings file:

- Has one launch profile named `https`.
- Configures an .NET Aspire app host project:
  - The `applicationUrl` property configures the dashboard launch address (`ASPNETCORE_URLS`).
  - Environment variables such as `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL` and `DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` are set on the app host.

For more information, see [.NET Aspire and launch profiles](../fundamentals/launch-profiles.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration described on this page is for .NET Aspire app host project. To configure the standalone dashboard, see [dashboard configuration](../fundamentals/dashboard/configuration.md).

## Common configuration

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` | `false` | Allows communication with the app host without https. `ASPNETCORE_URLS` (dashboard address) and `DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` (app host resource service address) must be secured with HTTPS unless true. |
| `DOTNET_ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` | `docker` | Allows the user of alternative container runtimes for resources backed by containers. Possible values are `docker` (default) or `podman`. See [Setup and tooling overview for more details](../fundamentals/setup-tooling.md).  |

## Resource service

A resource service is hosted by the app host. The resource service is used by the dashboard to fetch information about resources which are being orchestrated by .NET Aspire.

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` | `null` | Configures the address of the resource service hosted by the app host. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. For example, `https://localhost:17037`. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_RESOURCESERVICE_APIKEY` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The API key used to authenticate requests made to the app host's resource service. The API key is required if the app host is in run mode, the dashboard isn't disabled, and the dashboard isn't configured to allow anonymous access with `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`. |

## Dashboard

By default, the dashboard is automatically started by the app host. The dashboard supports [its own set of configuration](../fundamentals/dashboard/configuration.md), and some settings can be configured from the app host.

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | `null` | Dashboard address. Must be `https` unless `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` or `DistributedApplicationOptions.AllowUnsecuredTransport` is true. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. The value in launch settings is set on the `applicationUrls` property. |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | `Production` | Configures the environment the dashboard runs as. For more information, see [Use multiple environments in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments). |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL` | `http://localhost:18889` if no gRPC endpoint is configured. | Configures the dashboard OTLP gRPC address. Used by the dashboard to receive telemetry over OTLP. Set on resources as the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var is `grpc`.  Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` | `null` | Configures the dashboard OTLP HTTP address. Used by the dashboard to receive telemetry over OTLP. If only `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` is configured then it is set on resources as the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var is `http/protobuf`. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `null` | Overrides the CORS allowed origins configured in the dashboard. This setting replaces the default behavior of calculating allowed origins based on resource endpoints. |
| `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_BROWSERTOKEN` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | Configures the frontend browser token. This is the value that must be entered to access the dashboard when the auth mode is BrowserToken. If no browser token is specified then a new token is generated each time the app host is launched. |

## Internal

Internal settings are used by the app host and integrations. Internal settings aren't designed to be configured directly.

| Option | Default value | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `AppHost:Directory` | The content root if there's no project. | Directory of the project where the app host is located. Accessible from the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.AppHostDirectory?displayProperty=nameWithType>. |
| `AppHost:Path` | The directory combined with the application name. | The path to the app host. It combines the directory with the application name. |
| `AppHost:Sha256` | It is created from the app host name when the app host is in publish mode. Otherwise it is created from the app host path. | Hex encoded hash for the current application. The hash is based on the location of the app on the current machine so it is stable between launches of the app host. |
| `AppHost:OtlpApiKey` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The API key used to authenticate requests sent to the dashboard OTLP service. The value is present if needed: the app host is in run mode, the dashboard isn't disabled, and the dashboard isn't configured to allow anonymous access with `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`. |
| `AppHost:BrowserToken` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The browser token used to authenticate browsing to the dashboard when it is launched by the app host. The browser token can be set by `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_BROWSERTOKEN`. The value is present if needed: the app host is in run mode, the dashboard isn't disabled, and the dashboard isn't configured to allow anonymous access with `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`. |
| `AppHost:ResourceService:AuthMode` | `ApiKey`. If `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` is true then the value is `Unsecured`. | The authentication mode used to access the resource service. The value is present if needed: the app host is in run mode and the dashboard isn't disabled. |
| `AppHost:ResourceService:ApiKey` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The API key used to authenticate requests made to the app host's resource service. The API key can be set by `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_RESOURCESERVICE_APIKEY`. The value is present if needed: the app host is in run mode, the dashboard isn't disabled, and the dashboard isn't configured to allow anonymous access with `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`. |
