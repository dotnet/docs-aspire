# Eventing in .NET Aspire

In .NET Aspire, eventing allows you to publish and subscribe to events during various [app host life cycles](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host#app-host-life-cycles). Eventing is more flexible than life cycle events. Both let you run arbitrary code during event callbacks, but eventing offers finer control of event timing, publishing, and provides supports for custom events.

The eventing mechanisms in .NET Aspire are part of the [ðŸ“¦ Aspire.Hosting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting) NuGet package. This package provides a set of interfaces and classes in the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing> namespace that you use to publish and subscribe to events in your .NET Aspire app host project. Eventing is scoped to the app host itself and the resources within.

In this article, you learn how to use the eventing features in .NET Aspire.

## App host eventing

The following events are available in the app host and occur in the following order:

1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.BeforeStartEvent>: This event is raised before the app host starts.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AfterEndpointsAllocatedEvent>: This event is raised after the app host allocated endpoints.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.AfterResourcesCreatedEvent>: This event is raised after the app host created resources.

All of the preceding events are analogous to the [app host life cycles](xref:dotnet/aspire/app-host#app-host-life-cycles). That is, an implementation of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> could handle these events just the same. With the eventing API, however, you can run arbitrary code when these events are raised and event define custom eventsâ€”any event that implements the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEvent> interface.

### Subscribe to app host events

To subscribe to the built-in app host events, use the eventing API. After you have a distributed application builder instance, walk up to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.Eventing?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.Subscribe``1(System.Func{``0,System.Threading.CancellationToken,System.Threading.Tasks.Task})> API. Consider the following sample app host _Program.cs_ file:

:::code source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Program.cs" highlight="17-25,27-35,37-45":::

The preceding code is based on the starter template with the addition of the calls to the `Subscribe` API. The `Subscribe<T>` API returns a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.DistributedApplicationEventSubscription> instance that you can use to unsubscribe from the event. It's common to discard the returned subscriptions, as you don't usually need to unsubscribe from events as the entire app is torn down when the app host is shut down.

When the app host is run, by the time the .NET Aspire dashboard is displayed, you should see the following log output in the console:

:::code language="Plaintext" source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Console.txt" highlight="2,10,16":::

The log output confirms that event handlers are executed in the order of the app host life cycle events. The subscription order doesn't affect execution order. The `BeforeStartEvent` is triggered first, followed by `AfterEndpointsAllocatedEvent`, and finally `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent`.

## Resource eventing

In addition to the app host events, you can also subscribe to resource events. Resource events are raised specific to an individual resource. Resource events are defined as implementations of the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationResourceEvent> interface. The following resource events are available in the listed order:

1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ConnectionStringAvailableEvent>: Raised when a connection string becomes available for a resource.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.BeforeResourceStartedEvent>: Raised before the orchestrator starts a new resource.
1. <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceReadyEvent>: Raised when a resource initially transitions to a ready state.

### Subscribe to resource events

To subscribe to resource events, use the eventing API. After you have a distributed application builder instance, walk up to the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.IDistributedApplicationBuilder.Eventing?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and call the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.Subscribe``1(Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResource,System.Func{``0,System.Threading.CancellationToken,System.Threading.Tasks.Task})> API. Consider the following sample app host _Program.cs_ file:

:::code source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.ResourceAppHost/Program.cs" highlight="8-17,19-28,30-39":::

The preceding code subscribes to the `ResourceReadyEvent`, `ConnectionStringAvailableEvent`, and `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` events on the `cache` resource. When <xref:Aspire.Hosting.RedisBuilderExtensions.AddRedis*> is called, it returns an <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder`1> where `T` is a <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.RedisResource>. The resource builder exposes the resource as the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder`1.Resource?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. The resource in question is then passed to the `Subscribe` API to subscribe to the events on the resource.

When the app host is run, by the time the .NET Aspire dashboard is displayed, you should see the following log output in the console:

:::code language="Plaintext" source="snippets/AspireApp/AspireApp.ResourceAppHost/Console.txt" highlight="8,10,12":::

> [!NOTE]
> Some events are blocking. For example, when the `BeforeResourceStartEvent` is published, the startup of the resource will be blocked until all subscriptions for that event on a given resource have completed executing. Whether an event is blocking or not depends on how it is published (see the following section).

## Publish events

When subscribing to any of the built-in events, you don't need to publish the event yourself as the app host orchestrator manages to publish built-in events on your behalf. However, you can publish custom events with the eventing API. To publish an event, you have to first define an event as an implementation of either the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEvent> or <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationResourceEvent> interface. You need to determine which interface to implement based on whether the event is a global app host event or a resource-specific event.

Then, you can subscribe and publish the event by calling the either of the following APIs:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.PublishAsync``1(``0,System.Threading.CancellationToken)>: Publishes an event to all subscribes of the specific event type.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.PublishAsync``1(``0,Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior,System.Threading.CancellationToken)>: Publishes an event to all subscribes of the specific event type with a specified dispatch behavior.

### Provide an `EventDispatchBehavior`

When events are dispatched, you can control how the events are dispatched to subscribers. The event dispatch behavior is specified with the `EventDispatchBehavior` enum. The following behaviors are available:

- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.BlockingSequential?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events sequentially and blocks until they're all processed.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.BlockingConcurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events concurrently and blocks until they are all processed.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.NonBlockingSequential?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events sequentially but doesn't block.
- <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.EventDispatchBehavior.NonBlockingConcurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Fires events concurrently but doesn't block.

The default behavior is `EventDispatchBehavior.BlockingSequential`. To override this behavior, when calling a publishing API such as <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Eventing.IDistributedApplicationEventing.PublishAsync*>, provide the desired behavior as an argument.

## App Host life cycle events in .NET Aspire

As you have seen, eventing is the most flexible approach. However, in this section you learn about the alternative: life cycle events.

The .NET Aspire app host exposes several life cycles that you can hook into by implementing the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> interface. The following lifecycle methods are available:

| Order | Method | Description |
|--|--|--|
| **1** | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook.BeforeStartAsync%2A> | Executes before the distributed application starts. |
| **2** | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook.AfterEndpointsAllocatedAsync%2A> | Executes after the orchestrator allocates endpoints for resources in the application model. |
| **3** | <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook.AfterResourcesCreatedAsync%2A> | Executes after the resource was created by the orchestrator. |

### Register a life cycle hook

To register a life cycle hook, implement the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> interface and register the hook with the app host using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.LifecycleHookServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLifecycleHook*> API:

:::code source="../fundamentals/snippets/lifecycles/AspireApp/AspireApp.AppHost/Program.cs":::

The preceding code:

- Implements the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.IDistributedApplicationLifecycleHook> interface as a `LifecycleLogger`.
- Registers the life cycle hook with the app host using the <xref:Aspire.Hosting.Lifecycle.LifecycleHookServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLifecycleHook*> API.
- Logs a message for all the events.

When this app host is run, the life cycle hook is executed for each event. The following output is generated:

```Output
info: LifecycleLogger[0]
      BeforeStartAsync
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Aspire version: 9.0.0
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Distributed application starting.
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Application host directory is: ..\AspireApp\AspireApp.AppHost
info: LifecycleLogger[0]
      AfterEndpointsAllocatedAsync
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:17043
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17043/login?t=d80f598bc8a64c7ee97328a1cbd55d72
info: LifecycleLogger[0]
      AfterResourcesCreatedAsync
info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
      Distributed application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

The preferred way to hook into the app host life cycle is to use the eventing API. For more information, see [Eventing in .NET Aspire](#eventing-in-net-aspire).
