# .NET Aspire Valkey component

<!--
https://github.com/dotnet/docs-aspire/issues/1049

We are introducing support for Valkey in this PR:

dotnet/aspire#4324

It is presently a drop in alternative for Redis. We probably need an article that sites right alongside the Redis articles so that folks who might be looking for Redis content to understand how Valkey works can find it.

The article should cover:

AddValkey
WithDataVolume/WithBindMount
WithPersistence
It can probably cover off the client side pieces by just referring back to the Redis article although the Redis article might need to more clearly call out which is service code and which is app host code.

Configuring Valkey using AddValkey and using the data volume and persistence extension methods.
