The Redis hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the appropriate resource type. The health check verifies that the server is running and that a connection can be established to it.

The hosting integration relies on the [ðŸ“¦ AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Redis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Redis) NuGet package.
