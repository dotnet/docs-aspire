[Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is a Redis fork and complies with the [Redis serialization protocol](../stackexchange-redis-caching-overview.md#redis-serialization-protocol-resp) (RESP). It's a high-performance key/value datastore that supports a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can act as a primary database. The .NET Aspire Redis integration enables you to connect to existing Valkey instances, or create new instances from .NET with the [`docker.io/valkey/valkey` container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey/).
