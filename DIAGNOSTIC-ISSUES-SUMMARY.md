# Summary: Diagnostic Issues for PR #12416

## What was done

Created comprehensive documentation and templates for three new diagnostic codes introduced in [dotnet/aspire PR #12416](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/12416).

## Background

PR #12416 renamed and split the single `ASPIREPUBLISHERS001` diagnostic code into three sequential diagnostic codes under the ASPIREPIPELINES naming scheme. This change allows developers to selectively suppress diagnostics based on which specific experimental features they're using.

## The Three New Diagnostics

### ASPIREPIPELINES001 - Pipeline Infrastructure
- **Type:** Warning  
- **Version:** 9.2
- **Covers:** Core pipeline infrastructure APIs including `IPipelineActivityReporter`, `IReportingStep`, `IReportingTask`, `CompletionState`, `PublishingContext`, `PublishingCallbackAnnotation`, and all types in `Aspire.Hosting.Pipelines` namespace

### ASPIREPIPELINES002 - Deployment State Management
- **Type:** Warning
- **Version:** 9.2
- **Covers:** Deployment state management APIs including `IDeploymentStateManager`, implementations, and `PublishingOptions.Deploy`, `.ClearCache`, `.Step` properties

### ASPIREPIPELINES003 - Container Image Building  
- **Type:** Warning
- **Version:** 9.2
- **Covers:** Container image building APIs including `IResourceContainerImageBuilder`, `ContainerBuildOptions`, `ContainerImageFormat`, `ContainerTargetPlatform`, and Docker/Podman runtime implementations

## Files Created

In `/proposed-diagnostic-issues/` directory:

1. **ASPIREPIPELINES001.md** - Complete issue template data for pipeline infrastructure diagnostic
2. **ASPIREPIPELINES002.md** - Complete issue template data for deployment state management diagnostic
3. **ASPIREPIPELINES003.md** - Complete issue template data for container image building diagnostic
4. **README.md** - Instructions for creating the GitHub issues manually or via CLI/API
5. **POST-CREATION-TASKS.md** - Documentation tasks to be completed after issues are created

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Create GitHub Issues

Someone with appropriate repository permissions needs to create three GitHub issues using the template at:
https://github.com/dotnet/docs-aspire/issues/new?template=06-diagnostic-addition.yml

The complete information for each issue is in the corresponding `.md` file in the `proposed-diagnostic-issues` directory. See the README.md in that directory for detailed instructions.

### After Issues are Created: Documentation

Once the issues are created and assigned, documentation pages need to be created:

1. Create `/docs/diagnostics/aspirepipelines001.md`
2. Create `/docs/diagnostics/aspirepipelines002.md`
3. Create `/docs/diagnostics/aspirepipelines003.md`
4. Update `/docs/diagnostics/overview.md` to include the new diagnostics
5. Update `/docs/diagnostics/aspirepublishers001.md` with an obsolescence notice pointing to the new diagnostics

See `POST-CREATION-TASKS.md` for complete details on these documentation updates.

## Why This Approach?

The GitHub Copilot agent cannot directly create GitHub issues due to authentication and permission constraints. Instead, this solution provides:

1. **Complete, structured information** for each diagnostic in a format that matches the issue template requirements
2. **Clear instructions** for creating the issues manually or programmatically
3. **Documentation guidance** for the work that will follow issue creation
4. **All necessary details** extracted from the source PR, including:
   - Exact API lists from code changes
   - Context from PR description
   - Appropriate code examples
   - Correct suppression methods

This ensures that whoever creates the issues has all the information they need in a ready-to-use format.
